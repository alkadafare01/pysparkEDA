Analytical Stats on:
Size of the data sets,
Field Types,
N-rows & N-columns,
Null values,
Repeated (deduplication!)
Redundant columns.
Columns that needs further treatment (intuition)
Summary stats for columns/fields
Central tendencies, interquartile measures, distances
skew, kurtosis, outliers etc. Value Range and Top/Bottom valued for fields, etc.

Exploratory Visualizations:
Data Distribution plots
Box Plots
Intra and inter filed Variance
Modality of data
Collinearity and Covariance among variables
Boxplots for outliers and Quartile distros.
Correlation Heatmaps, Auto regression lines.
Interactive Plots for What-If-Analysis, Etc.
Measures of data quality is an added advantage!
Automation and amenability to CI/CD is a good measure
Solution maintainability and extensibility matter a lot.
